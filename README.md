# Datasets_Analysis
Various datasets are analyzed to extract meaningful information and identify patterns and relationships in the data.
1. `Facial Expression Detection` - Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to accurately recognize emotions like anger, sadness, happiness, etc. Preprocessed and augmented a dataset of 48x48 grayscale images by applying various techniques.
2. `Telecom Customer Churn Prediction` - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key churn drivers in telecom data. Reduced feature dimensions by 95% using PCA without compromising model integrity. Developed an XGBoost classifier with 81.4% accuracy and readied the model for deployment via a Flask API.
3. `WhatsApp Chat Analyzer` - Developed a tool called WhatsApp Chat Analyzer that lets you track your conversation patterns, identify the most active users in your chats, and generate reports on your chat activity. EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) is performed on the exported chats using a Python data manipulation library called Pandas and visualised through Matplotlib and Seaborn. The charts and graphs are displayed using a Python library called Streamlit.
4. `House Price Predictor` - Developed a predictive model to predict the house price using a Linear Regression algorithm. Before this, performed data cleaning and feature engineering using Jupyter Notebook to make the data suitable for training.
